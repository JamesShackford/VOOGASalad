* Miguel and I discussed the front-end parts of both our projects. While his team is implementing a tower defense game, mine is a scrolling platformer, introducing some 
concrete differences between the two. One point of discussion was of the level of integration necessary between the two parts of the front-end, the Game Player, and the 
Game Authoring Environment. The two have to share the same user interface basics, meaning that there will need to be some information shared between the two.
Furthermore, if the game needs to be editable while being played, the game authoring environment and game player cannot be too separate from one another.
